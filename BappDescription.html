<p>Burp Variables adds variable storage and replacement to Burp Suite. Define variables once and reference them across
	requests using <code class="InlineCode">((variableName))</code> notation, similar to environment variables in
	Postman or Insomnia.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Store and manage variables in a dedicated tab, providing a single place to update tokens, credentials, and
		identifiers</li>
	<li>Variable references can be automatically replaced in outgoing requests from the Repeater, Proxy, Intruder,
		Scanner, and Extensions tools</li>
	<li>Proxy variable replacement is restricted to in-scope requests, preventing variable values from being sent to
		unintended destinations</li>
	<li>Auto-updating variables can extract values from HTTP responses using a regex capture group, keeping tokens and
		session IDs current automatically</li>
	<li>Use the right-click context menu in requests to insert variable references at the cursor or replace selected
		text</li>
	<li>Import and export variables as CSV for backup or sharing across projects</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Navigate to the "Variables" tab and add name-value pairs</li>
	<li>Add variable references to any outgoing request, using the notation <code
			class="InlineCode">((variableName))</code></li>
	<li>Send the request. Variable references are replaced with their stored values before the request leaves Burp</li>
	<li>Verify replacements occurred by inspecting the sent request in the "Logger" tool</li>
</ol>
