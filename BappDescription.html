<p>This extension adds variable support to Burp Suite, allowing users to save and reuse values in their requests, similar to features found in Postman or Insomnia.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Increases productivity by giving users a single place to update tokens, credentials, and identifiers for use in outgoing requests</li>
	<li>Variables can be included in requests sent from the Repeater, Proxy, Intruder, Scanner, and Extension tools</li>
	<li>Variables in requests sent through the Proxy tool are only replaced for requests within the project scope, ensuring variable values are not exposed to arbitrary destinations</li>
	<li>Variable data can be copied between projects by using the import and export options</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Add variable name-value pairs to the table in the Variables tab</li>
	<li>Add variable references to any outgoing request, using the notation <code>((variableName))</code></li>
	<li>Send the request</li>
	<li>Confirm the variable references were replaced by viewing the request using the "Logger" tool</li>
</ol>
